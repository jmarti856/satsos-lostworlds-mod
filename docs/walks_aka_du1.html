		<h1>Akaria Dungeon 1 - Main hub area</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>After the cut-scene head down the ramp, jump through the waterfall onto the ledge in front of you. Dispose of the enemy worshipper.</li>
			<li>Follow the edge of the water around until you see a crabclaw enemy. Dispose of this and hit the Resonate Crystals on your right.</li>
			<li>In front of you is a giant salt Crystal hit this and collects the pick-up that’s dropped. Swimming around in the water are turtles, when one of these gets close to the edge jump onto its back. Its will swim past a small rock Island in the middle of the water jump onto this. From here you can gain access onto a 2nd turtles back, when it swims close to the edge you can jump form its back and on to the other side.</li>
			<li>The way you approach this next areea will all depend on where you exited the turtle. On your left head back towards the big waterfall, there is a 2nd Resonate Crystals you need to hit being guarded by an enemy worshipper.</li>
			<li>Once accomplished turn around and head all the way to the end where the water is falling over the edge. In front of you is a series of ledges, jump up and along these. The 2nd ledge contains the 3rd Resonate Crystal.</li>
			<li>Jump onto the first swinging rope then over onto the 2nd one. Climb up the 2nd rope a little and jump over onto the ledge. Don’t worry too much if you fall from the ropes there is a change you’ll land on a ledge lower down. From here you can climb back up onto the 3rd Resonate Crystal ledge.</li>
			<li>In front of you is a locked door, to your left is a Crystal holder use your slat crystal and this will open the door.</li>
			<li>Instead of going through the door straight away we should finishes hitting all the Resonate Crystals. So head right of the door and jump down onto the ledge with the giant Resonate Crystals blocking the gap. Once on here jump down onto the next ledge with the last of the Resonate Crystals (4)</li>
			<li>You have now opened the hub area that will enable the player to collect the 4 pearls you will need.</li>
		</ul>	
		<h2>What you do next</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Once you’ve collected all 4 pearl climb back up to the door you first opened. (The one you saw Ishka go through) You will now be entering the pearl room.</li>
			<li>Once in here you will need to deposit the 4 pearls you’ve collected on the stands. This will open the door to the boss room.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Secret Areas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Pearl room – once you’ve run down the passage you will come to a ledge instead of jumping down following  the waterfall to the bottom there is a ledge above you. Jump up here, at the end you will find a leaver, use it. This will open a secret room below the waterfall half way down.</li>
			<li>Pearl room – At the bottom of the small waterfall is a pool, looking around you can see a hole covered by a grate. Sword slam this and swim down the tunnel for an alternative way in</li>
			<li>Main Hub area – The little rock Island in the middle of the water has a mine floating around it. If you destroy the mine this blow up a big bolder under the water creating a hole. Swim down this and it will lead you to a secret room.</li>
