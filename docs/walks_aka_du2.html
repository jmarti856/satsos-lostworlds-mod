		<h1>Akaria Dungeon 2</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>This room contains one of the 4 quest items the player will need if they are to gain access to Ishka’s chamber. A raised platform at one end of the level has a closed door and item holder outside it. The player must open this door if they’re to access the quest item.</li>
			<li>A giant salt crystal is visible on the players stating platform, Hit this using your sword and it will drop a small crystal for you to pick-up. Be careful not to get into or pass through water while carrying one of these crystals or it will dissolve.</li>
			<li>Move down the path closest to the salt crystal, you will notice that large boulders are being flung down these paths, if they hit you they will knock you off or and hurt you.</li>
			<li>Part way down this path on the left is a ledge jump up here, then down onto the platform below. You have to go this way as the path moves through a waterfall this would dissolve the salt crystal.</li>
			<li>Jump from this platform back up onto the path, a little way below you there is a platform with a container on it. Jump down here.</li>
			<li>Smash open the container grabbing the pick-up. Then jump over onto the next path. Follow this down to the end then jump up onto the climbable section.</li>
			<li>Climb all the way to the top then jump or drop onto the upper path. Now run all the down to the door at the other end. Use the salt crystal on the item holder this will open the door. Run in and grab the pearl by smashing the container,</li>
			<li>There is a giant Resonate Crystal across the exit to the level. You may have noticed smaller ones of these doted around on platforms. You must go back and active all of these if you are to exit.</li>
			<li>You can now exit along the corridor.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h2>Secret Areas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>On the second platform the player dropped down onto above there heads is a sword swipe button, Hitting this will open up a secret room at the top of the high path – but you only have a limited time to get into the room before it closes again.</li>
