		<h1>Heliopolis Dark Area 2</h1>
		<p>Take a right and follow the hill. At the gate, you’ll see that you need to insert a glyph key into the stand to open it. Climb the rope to the right of the gate and jump onto the ledge. Do a sword smash on the tile to create temporary platforms. Jump across them and smash the container on the other side. Collect the glyph key. Use it in the stand to open the gate.</p>
		<p>Go through the gate and talk to the nomad. He’ll ask you to help liberate the nearby settlement from the zombies.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Activate the bridge ahead by hitting the smash switch with your sword. Cross it to reach the settlement.</li>
			<li>In this area, defeat all the zombies roaming around.</li>
			<li>Once all the zombies are defeated, return to the nomad. He will offer you papyrus, which you need to give the shopkeeper in Heliopolis in exchange for a passcard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After this, talk to the second nomad. She’ll ask you to find three seeds.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use an armadillo to burn through the wooden fence blocking the tunnel entrance and go inside.</li>
			<li>Hit the smash switch to create moving platforms. Jump across them. Take a right and go up the hill. Double jump onto the wooden frame to grab it. ‘Monkey Walk’ across the structure and drop off at the end. Jump on the climbable wall on the right. Make your way as far to the right as possible and drop off. Go through the tunnel.</li>
			<li>Defeat the 3 monsters in the next area to unblock the path. Proceed through the tunnel.</li>
			<li>Use an armadillo again to burn the wooden gate blocking the exit. Then hit the smash switch to activate a bridge and cross it.</li>
			<li>Return to the second nomad. She will reward you with a bottle of ink, which you will also need to give the shopkeeper in Heliopolis along with the papyrus to receive the passcard.</li>
			<li>Once you have both items, use the teleporter in the settlement you just passed through after exiting the cave to return to the Heliopolis exterior, right next to the shopkeeper.</li>
