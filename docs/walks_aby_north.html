		<h1>Abydos North</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>From the players start position walk forwards onto the wooden platforms and follow these round until the camera cuts showing you a statue. </li>
			<li>Stand in front of the statue and jump up onto it. Once on the statue perform a jumping sword slam. The statue should now start to lower into the water.</li>
			<li>Once the statue has stopped moving jump onto the small ledge on your left. From here you should be able to jump right and behind the statue, here is the first pick-up.</li>
			<li>Jump off the statue back down onto the wooden walkway. And continue along it passed the NPC and through the arch.</li>
			<li>You should now be in a sort of market area under sunshades. To you right are more wooden platforms in the water. Turn around to face the arch you’ve just come through and move over to the right.</li>
			<li>A little ahead of you is a platform with a rope above it. Jump onto this platform and clime up the rope.</li>
			<li>Once at the top double jump off the rope and onto the sunshade. Run along these to the building in the centre. If you walk around this you will notice another pick-up in the centre – but gates on each side obstruct access.</li>
			<li>Continue along the sunshades until you are on the opposite too the rope. On you left above you is wooden veranda, jump up while underneath this and you should grad a hold. Moving forward in a monkey like fashion. Follow this around until you come to a wooden platform below you, drop down onto it. Here you will find another pick-up.</li>
			<li>Drop down off the platform and run through the archway following this around until you come to a sort of dock. You should be able to see two ships. Go over to the first one.</li>
			<li>This first ship is the travelling salesman, Jump onto his ship and over to the platforms on the other side. Follow these all the way to the end being careful not to fall into the water. When on the round stauncher you can get this pick up. Go back along the platforms back onto the ship, then back onto the stone dock.</li>
			<li>Continue along the dock heading towards the other ship. You will come to what looks like a bit of a dead end with a lever in the middle. Don’t pull the lever yet.</li>
			<li>As there is no platform to get you across too the other stone dock you will have to use the rail hanging off the wall. Jump up and grab hold of this and move along it until your able to drop down.</li>
			<li>Once on the dock go over to the block, pick this up and move it into the centre of the cage like stauncher. Drop the block in the middle of this.</li>
			<li>Once the block is in the middle of the cage move back along the rail and pull the lever. The crane will stat to lift the block, you need to move back along the rail and run over to the wooden stauncher at the opposite end and stand on the canopy, make sure your stood facing the 2nd ship.</li>
			<li>The crane will drop the block onto the end of the wooden stauncher catapulting the player over onto the 2nd ship. Once on here you will see a pearl pick-up. Get this and jump into the water and swim over to the wooden pier, up the ladder and back onto the dock.</li>
			<li>Run back to the sunshade area and back up the rope over to the cross object. When you get near to it the object should start to re-act. Now the gates are open you can gain access to the last of the pick-ups.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h2>Locating the missing lever handle</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>From the start, follow the path to the market square.  There’s a door here with a green circle above it. (54.63  -12.52  42.46) Shoot the target with the darts three times.  This triggers a cutscene requiring you to return to <a href="walks_aby_south.html" target="_blank">Abydos South</a> to find the thief with the handle.</li>
