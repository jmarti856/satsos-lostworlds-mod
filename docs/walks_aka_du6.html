		<h1>Akarian Boss fight</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The player must now face the demon Ishka who has been changed into a winged beast floating high above the arena. Once in the main arena the player is unable to leave until the boss has been defeated. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Ishka’s attack and how you defend against it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dotted around the arena are four giant ruins, draw Ishka’s fireball attacks towards you then hide behind the ruins. It only takes one fireball on each of the ruins to destroy them revealing a Resonate Crystal underneath each.<br>Once exposed hit each one – but before hitting the last wait until the Ishka demon is in the middle of the arena above the salt crystal. On hitting the last one this will generate a giant shockwave that Ishka should take a lot of damage from. It will take a few of these to finally slay him.</li>
			<li>When Ishka is just above the player you can use your jumping sword swipe – but this will not do a lot of damage.</li>
			<li>Ishka will stop in front of the player and start to flap his wings in doing this he will create a wind witch will push the player backwards. You must run forwards towards Ishka when he does this to avoid getting blown off the arena platform.</li>
