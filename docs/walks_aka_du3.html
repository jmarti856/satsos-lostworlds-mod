		<h1>Akaria Dungeon 3</h1>
		<h2>Pearl 3</h2>
		<p>You must have the red crystal from section C, enter this level from the entrance located at :- ( -9.17 , 40.02 , 25.02) in (_ak_du1). From this entrance go to the red pedestal and use the red crystal key, a cutscene will play of a large pearl (from a statue) fall into the water and break. Jump in the water to collect pearl 3.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Pearl 4</h2>
		<p>Pearl 4 is located in the other large pearl on the statue. The first thing to do is hit 4 more crystals to blowup a large crystal barrer, once this is done you use the platform the large crystal was on ( -45.89 , 18.50 , -34.14)</p>
		<p>Locations of 4 crystals to hit :-</p>
		<p>( -95.81 , 7.85 , -43.71 )<br>( -61.02 , 7.62 , -29.05 )<br>( -29.70 , 15.55 , -12.19 )<br>( -17.27 , 12.97 , -51.81 )</p>
		<p>Follow the platforms until you find a rotating mine hanging from the ceiling ( -78.04 , 20.13 , -28.40) , shoot this with a dart in the green area to destroy it and knock down the stalactites. Use the stalactites as platforms to reach the green crystal and smash it to get the green salt crystal.</p>
		<p>Head towards area with a worshipper walking about and speak to him ( -101.69 , 13.09 , -43.28) , he will tell us about the pearls which is false information as he will then turn into a evil skeleton worshipper, defeat him then climb up the rope and enter the entrance there ( -103.23 , 19.10 , -53.32 )<br>Go down the slide avoiding the water to keep the green salt crystal. At the end you will be back in room 3 again but behind the waterfall near the green pedestal, use the pedestal and watch the cutscene of the other pearl falling from the statue. Jump in the water and collect pearl 4.</p>
		<p>Exit back to (_ak_du1) through the entrance at :- ( -105.74 , 7.47 , -25.30 )</p>
		<h2>Secrets</h2>
		<p>Two rewards can be found under the platform where the large crystal was, pull out the handle to open 2 secret compartments.</p>
