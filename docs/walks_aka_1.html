		<h1>Akaria 1</h1>
		<p>Cutscene of the diving bell (from Abydos) plays</p>
		<p>Camera cut to the inside. If lever is pulled the diving bell will go back to Abydos</p>
		<p>Jump into the water hole and head towards the red coloured exit, using the rising water bubbles to keep your air health bar topped up. The glass tube has an entrance underneath so use that to get ashore.</p>
		<p>Once inside head down the corrider leading to the Dome.</p>
		<p>Cutscene showing the Dome</p>
		<p>Head right and talk to the sleeping Akarian. He will tell you about the events taken place and will give you information about using the crystal keys to unlock the palace doors.<br>Break the red crystals (they grow back so you can keep coming back) and pickup the salt crystal. As explained by the Akarian if you touch water while holding the crystal it will dissolve. Take the crystal to the door across the other side of the room avoiding the tidal water. Once there use the red slab to open the door. (cutscene of door opening)</p>
		<p>Head up and a short cutscene of someone being chased will play, kill the crabhand and continue. You will now come to a bridge leading to the spiral central support. Get across the bridge (avoiding the electric beams which turn on and off) and head up the spiral ramp.</p>
		<p>The first bridge leading off the spiral ramp leads to the green crystal, which you will need to get to escape this area. Head up this bridge avoiding the electric beams. Once up the bridge head right to a broken bridge and look down, part of another bridge is below and you must jump down to this.<br>Some chests here contain some health. Coming to the next bridge section you will notice that the electric beams here do not turn off but have a crystal like button above it. Shoot these with your blowpipe, after shooting 3 and getting past a cutscene will play of a crabhand killing another Akarian. Head across the bridge and kill the crabhand. Here is the location of the green crystal. Smash it and pick it up and drop down to the bottom of the spiral ramp.<br>Head up to the top of it and across the top bridge and open the green door.</p>
		<p>Follow the corrider around and meet up with a Akarian guard. Whilst talking with him a large quake/sound erupts and the guard runs off to tell the king. You can now either head back to the dome (which you must do) or follow the guard.</p>
		<p>Following the guard down the corrider and to the left will lead to a slide. Slide down the corrider until the end and meet up with the guard at the bottom.<br>He will tell you that the main gates to the palace are locked and all 3 coloured crystals are needed. Use the teleporter to get to the top of the slide and head back to the Dome.</p>
		<p>Getting back to the dome you will find that it is now flooded with water. As the red crystal is now submerged you will need to find another. Find the blue crystal (at the water level near the turtles) and use the turtles to cross the water to the central spiral. Head up to the top avoiding the waterfalls that are now turning on and off. Head towards the top of the slide but use the blue crystal on the blue door. Go through and you will find yourself in the dome again up on a ledge containing 3 coloured crystals. Smash them and collect all 3 then go back to the slide. Now you must get to the bottom of the slide avoiding the electric beams and the small waterfalls. Once at the bottom with the crystals intact open the door.</p>
		<p>Cutscene of door opening and guard running through</p>
		<p>Follow the guard to the palace entrance, cutscene of palace doors opening and sphinx running through to Aka_2</p>
